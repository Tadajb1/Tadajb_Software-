    <h3>CEO Information</h3>
    <p>Tada Musa JB is a young software engineering student and a programmer from Jubrilli, Nigeria. Tada showed an early interest in technology and education. He attended Jubrilli Nursery School around 2007 and later moved on to Jubrilli primary school francaphone in Cameroon. However, due to the Boko Haram insurgency, Tada was forced to seek refuge in Minawao Camp, Cameroon.
Despite the challenges he faced, Tada remained dedicated to his education. He started schooling in Cameroon around 2015 and is currently in Lower sixth science at GBHS Mokolo. His passion for technology and education led him to create Tadajb Software, an educational website that aims to provide quality learning resources to students around the world.
The story of Tada is of resilience and determination. His journey from a young boy in a refugee camp to a successful young web developer is an inspiration to many. Through Tadajb Software, he hopes to make a positive impact on the lives of others by providing them with the tools they need to succeed in their studies. To conclude this, he is showing his gratitude to Enginneer Garba John aka Amchide, for his continous support and encouragements in the world of technology. Thanks for reading. </p>
